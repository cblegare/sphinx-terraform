    How do I make a good changelog?
    ===============================

    Guiding Principles
    ------------------

    - Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
    - There should be an entry for every single version.
    - The same types of changes should be grouped.
    - Versions and sections should be linkable.
    - The latest version comes first.
    - The release date of each version is displayed.
    - Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.
